# Quarto

Quarto is a two-player strategy game played on a 4x4 board. Each player takes turns selecting and placing one of 16 pieces on the board. The first player to create a row or column with four pieces that share a common attribute (color, shape, height, or hollowness) wins the game.
## Rules

- Players take turns selecting a piece and placing it on the board. Once a piece is placed, it cannot be moved.
- The first player to create a row or column of four pieces that share a common attribute (color, shape, height, or hollowness) wins the game. The four pieces can be in any order and do not need to be adjacent to each other.
- If a player places a piece that completes a row or column of four matching pieces for their opponent, they lose the game.
- If all 16 pieces are placed on the board without either player winning, the game is a tie.
